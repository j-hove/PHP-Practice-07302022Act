##Instruction:
> Good day! Please do answer the practice exercises. As a challenge integrate it in your laravel app and have your outputs display as the return value for the route. Good luck!

### 1. Write a PHP program to print alphabet pattern 'A'.

Expected Output:

*** * * * * ***** * * * * * * * *

### 2. Write a PHP script to get JSON representation of a value from an array.
### 3. Write a PHP function to display JSON decode errors.

### 4. Write a PHP program to find a missing number(s) from an array.
Input : 1,2,3,6,7,8
Output : Array
(
[3] => 4
[4] => 5
)

### 5. Write a PHP program to find three numbers from an array such that the sum of three consecutive numbers equal to zero.

Input : (-1,0,1,2,-1,-4)
Output : Array
(
[0] => -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
)
### 6. Write a PHP program to compute and return the square root of a given number.
Input : 16
Output : 4
### 7. Write a PHP program to find the single element in an array where every element appears three times except for one.

Input : array(5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3)
Output : Array
(
[0] => 5
[1] => 3
[2] => 4
[3] => 3
[4] => 5
[5] => 5
[6] => 3
)
Single Number: 4

### 8. Write a PHP program to check whether a sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression or not.
In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
Input : array(5, 7, 9, 11)
Output : An arithmetic sequence
For example, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 ... is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.

### 9. Write a PHP program to reverse the bits of an integer (32 bits unsigned). 

Input : 1234
Output: 1260388352
For example, 1234 represented in binary as 10011010010 and returns 1260388352 which represents in binary as 1001011001000000000000000000000.


### 10. Write a PHP program to add the digits of a positive integer repeatedly until the result has a single digit.
For example given number is 59, the result will be 5.
Input : 48
Output : 3
Step 1: 5 + 9 = 14
Step 1: 1 + 4 = 5
